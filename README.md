# Entropy Based Fuzzy Clustering

This repository contains the code and documentation for the project on Entropy Based Fuzzy Clustering. The project report can be found in the "Report of Project.pdf" file.

## Project Description

The project focuses on implementing entropy-based fuzzy clustering algorithm. The goal is to develop a clustering approach that incorporates fuzzy logic and entropy measures to provide more flexible and accurate clustering results. The project explores the theoretical foundations of fuzzy clustering and entropy, and presents the implementation details of the algorithm.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `Report of Project.pdf`: The project report that provides an overview of the project, methodology, experimental results, and conclusions.

- `PCA_and_Entropy_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and entropy-based clustering using Python. It includes loading the data, defining PCA from scratch, applying PCA on a sample dataset, and visualizing the results.

## Usage

To run the code and reproduce the results presented in the project report, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

2. Open the `PCA_and_Entropy_Clustering.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

3. Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially to load the data, define the PCA class, apply PCA on the sample dataset, and visualize the results.

4. Modify the code and parameters as needed to experiment with different datasets or variations of the algorithm.
